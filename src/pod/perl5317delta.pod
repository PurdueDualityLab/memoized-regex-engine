=head1 NAME

perl5317delta - what is new for perl v5.31.7

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.31.6 release and the 5.31.7
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.31.5, first read
L<perl5316delta>, which describes differences between 5.31.5 and 5.31.6.

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 The isa Operator

A new experimental infix operator called C<isa> tests whether a given object
is an instance of a given class or a class derived from it:

    if( $obj isa Package::Name ) { ... }

For more detail see L<perlop/Class Instance Operator>.

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=head2 C<\p{I<user-defined>}> properties now always override official
Unicode ones

Previously, if and only if a user-defined property was declared prior to
the compilation of the regular expression pattern containing it, its
definition was used instead of any official Unicode property with the
same name.  Now, it always overrides the official property.  This
change could break existing code that relied (likely unwittingly) on the
previous behavior.  Without this fix, if Unicode released a new version
with a new property that happens to have the same name as the one you
had long been using, your program would break when you upgraded to a
perl that used that new Unicode version.  See L<perlunicode/User-Defined
Character Properties>.  [L<GH #17205|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17205>]


=head1 Deprecations

=head2 Module removals

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

=head2 Changes to Existing Documentation

We have attempted to update the documentation to reflect the changes
listed in this document.  If you find any we have missed, send email
to L<perlbug@perl.org|mailto:perlbug@perl.org>.

Additionally, the following selected changes have been made:

=head3 L<perldebguts>

=item Simplify a couple regnode definitions

Update BOUND and NBOUND definitions.

=item Add ANYOFHs regnode

This node is like ANYOFHb, but is used when more than one leading byte
is the same in all the matched code points.

ANYOFHb is used to avoid having to convert from UTF-8 to code point for
something that won't match.  It checks that the first byte in the UTF-8
encoded target is the desired one, thus ruling out most of the possible
code points.

=head1 Acknowledgements

Perl 5.31.7 represents approximately 4 weeks of development since Perl
5.31.6 and contains approximately 9,300 lines of changes across 450 files
from 22 authors.

Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were
approximately 5,200 lines of changes to 280 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

Perl continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a vibrant
community of users and developers. The following people are known to have

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.

=head1 Give Thanks

If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl 5,
you can do so by running the C<perlthanks> program:

    perlthanks

This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of thanks.
